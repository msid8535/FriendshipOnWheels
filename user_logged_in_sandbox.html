                <p class="text-lg mt-10">FriendshipOnWheels is a nationwide non-profit initiative which aims to help
                    requestors
                    (frail, aged people and people with disability) remain in their homes by providing them with meals,
                    friendly visits and
                    safety checks on a regular basis. Volunteers donate their time to deliver meals, friendly
                    interactions and safety
                    checks, whereas Requestors/Carers are those who receive the meal.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="text-lg">Our goal is to connect the community through food and companionship, fostering a
                    sense of belonging and support for those who may feel isolated or vulnerable. Through our
                    dedicated team of volunteers and the generosity of donors, we strive to make a meaningful difference
                    in the lives of
                    individuals who may be facing challenges in maintaining their independence. Together, we can build
                    a stronger, more compassionate community where everyone feels valued and supported.</p>

                <p>We understand that everyone leads busy lives. That's why we offer flexible volunteer
                    opportunities that allow you to contribute to your community on your own terms. Our scheduling
                    system is designed to

                    other commitments.</p>

                <p class="text-right">Volunteering with FriendshipOnWheels isn't just about lending a helping hand—it's
                    about becoming an integral part of
                    your community. When you volunteer with us, you'll have the chance to connect with people from all
                    walks of life who
                    share a common goal: making a positive impact. Whether you're delivering meals, engaging in friendly
                    visits, or
                    conducting safety checks, you'll be working alongside fellow community members who are passionate
                    about serving others.</p>

                <p>One of the unique aspects of FriendshipOnWheels is the opportunity it provides to bridge the
                    generation gap and promote
                    intergenerational connections. Many of our volunteers are young adults or students looking to give
                    back to their
                    community, while many of our requestors are older individuals who may benefit greatly from the
                    energy and enthusiasm of
                    younger generations. By bringing together people of different ages and backgrounds, we foster mutual
                    understanding,
                    empathy, and respect. Through shared experiences and meaningful interactions, we break down barriers
                    and create a sense
                    of unity that transcends age differences. Join us in building a community where people of all ages
                    can learn from and
                    support one another.</p>
